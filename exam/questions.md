#### Questions@:, Lecture 1 Questions
- Considering a neural network with $D$ input neurons, a single hidden layer
  with $H$ neurons, $K$ output neurons, hidden activation $f$ and output
  activation $a$, list its parameters (including their size) and write down how
  the output is computed. [5]

- List the definitions of frequently used MLP output layer activations (the ones
  producing parameters of a Bernoulli distribution and a categorical distribution).
  Then write down three commonly used hidden layer activations (sigmoid, tanh,
  ReLU). [5]

- Formulate the Universal approximation theorem. [5]

#### Questions@:, Lecture 2 Questions
- Describe maximum likelihood estimation, as minimizing NLL, cross-entropy and
  KL divergence. [10]

- Define mean squared error and show how it can be derived using MLE. [5]

- Describe gradient descent and compare it to stochastic (i.e., online) gradient
  descent and minibatch stochastic gradient descent. [5]

- Formulate conditions on the sequence of learning rates used in SGD to converge
  to optimum almost surely. [5]

- Write down the backpropagation algorithm. [5]

- Write down the mini-batch SGD algorithm with momentum. Then, formulate
  SGD with Nesterov momentum and show the difference between them. [5]

- Write down the AdaGrad algorithm and show that it tends to internally decay
  learning rate by a factor of $1/\sqrt{t}$ in step $t$. Then write down
  the RMSProp algorithm and explain how it solves the problem with the
  involuntary learning rate decay. [10]

- Write down the Adam algorithm. Then show why the bias-correction terms
  $(1-\beta^t)$ make the estimation of the first and second moment unbiased.
