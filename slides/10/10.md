# Sequence-to-Sequence Architecture

Sequence-to-Sequence is a name for an architecture allowing to produce an
arbitrary output sequence $y_1, …, y_M$ from an input sequence
$→x_1, …, →x_N$.

Unlike CRF/CTC, no assumptions are necessary and we condition each output
sequence element on all input sequence elements and all already generated output
sequence elements:
$$P(y_i | →x_1, …, →x_N, y_1, …, y_{i-1}).$$

## Training

![w=50%,f=right](../07/sequence_prediction_training.svgz)

The so-called **teacher forcing** is used during training – the gold outputs are
used as inputs during training.

~~~
## Inference

![w=50%,f=right](../07/sequence_prediction_inference.svgz)

During inference, the network processes its own predictions – such an approach
is called **autoregressive decoding**.

Usually, the generated logits are processed by an $\argmax$, the chosen word
embedded and used as next input.

---
# Tying Word Embeddings

![w=86%,mw=30%,h=center,f=right](tying_embeddings.svgz)

In the decoder, we both:
- embed the previous prediction, using a matrix of size $ℝ^{V × D}$, where
  $V$ is the vocabulary size and $D$ is the embedding size;
- classify the hidden state into current prediction, using a matrix of
  size $ℝ^{D × V}$.

~~~
Both these matrices have the same meaning – they represent the target-side words
in the embedding space (the first explicitly represents the words by these embeddings,
the second chooses the embedding in a sense “closest” to the produced hidden state).

~~~
Therefore, it makes sense to **tie** these matrices, i.e., to represent one of
them as a transposition of the other.
~~~
- However, while the embedding matrix should usually have constant variance per
  dimension, the output layer should keep the variance of the RNN output;
  therefore, the output layer matrix is usually divided by $\sqrt{\textrm{RNN~dim}}$.

# Bahdanau Attention

![w=35%,f=right](attention.svgz)

As another input during decoding, we add _context vector_ $c_i$:
$$→s_i = f(→s_{i-1}, →y_{i-1}, →c_i).$$

~~~
We compute the context vector as a weighted combination of source sentence
encoded outputs:
$$→c_i = ∑_j α_{ij} →h_j$$

~~~
The weights $α_{ij}$ are softmax of $e_{ij}$ over $j$,
$$→α_i = \softmax(→e_i),$$
with $e_{ij}$ being
$$e_{ij} = →v^\top \tanh(⇉V→h_j + ⇉W→s_{i-1} + →b).$$

# Luong Attention

In the described _Bahdanau_ (or _additive_) attention, we performed
$$e_{ij} = →v^\top \tanh(⇉V→h_j + ⇉W→s_{i-1} + →b).$$

~~~
There are however other methods how $⇉V→h_j$ and $⇉W→s_{i-1}$ can be combined,
most notably the _Luong_ (or _dot-product_) attention, which uses just a dot
product:
$$e_{ij} = \big(⇉V→h_j\big)^T\big(⇉W→s_{i-1}\big).$$

~~~
The latter is easier to implement, but may sometimes be more difficult to train
(scaling helps a bit, wait for the Transformer self-attention description); both
approaches are used in quite a few papers.

section: SubWords
# Subword Units

Translate **subword units** instead of words. The subword units can be generated
in several ways, the most commonly used are:

~~~
- **BPE**:
  Using the _byte pair encoding_ algorithm. Start with individual characters plus
  a special end-of-word symbol $⋅$. Then, merge the most occurring symbol pair
  $A, B$ by a new symbol $AB$, with the symbol pair never crossing word boundary
  (so that the end-of-word symbol cannot be inside a subword).

~~~
  Considering text with words _low, lowest, newer, wider_, a possible sequence
  of merges:

  $$\begin{aligned}
    r \,\,\, ⋅ & → r⋅ \\
    l \,\,\, o & → lo \\
    lo \,\,\, w & → low \\
    e \,\,\, r⋅ & → er⋅ \\
  \end{aligned}$$

~~~
  The BPE algorithm is executed on the training data, and it generates the
  resulting dictionary, merging rules, and training data encoded using
  this dictionary.

---
# Subword Units

- **Wordpieces**:
  Given a text divided into subwords, we can compute unigram probability of
  every subword, and then get the likelihood of the text under a unigram language
  model by multiplying the probabilities of the subwords in the text.

~~~
  When we have only a text and a subword dictionary, we divide the text in
  a greedy fashion, iteratively choosing the longest existing subword.

~~~
  When constructing the subwords, we again start with individual characters, and
  then repeatedly join such a pair of subwords that increases the unigram
  language model likelihood the most.

~~~
  - In the original implementation, the input data were once in a while
    “reparsed” (retokenized) in a greedy fashion with the up-to-date dictionary.
    However, the recent implementations do not seem to do it – but they
    retokenize the training data with the final dictionary, contrary to the BPE
    approach.

~~~
For both approaches, usually quite little subword units are used (32k-64k),
often generated on the union of the two vocabularies of the source and target
languages (the so-called _joint BPE_ or _shared wordpieces_).

---
# BPE and WordPieces Comparison

Both the BPE and the WordPieces give very similar results; the biggest
difference is that during the inference:
- for BPE, the sequence of merges must be performed in the same order as during
  the construction of the BPE (because we use the output of BPE as training
  data),
~~~
- for Wordpieces, it is enough to find longest matches from the subword
  dictionary (because we reprocessed the training data with the final dictionary);
~~~
- note that the above difference is mostly artificial – if we reparsed the
  training data in the BPE approach, we could also perform “greedy
  tokenization”.

~~~
Of course, the two algorithms also differ in the way how they choose the pair of
subwords to merge.

~~~
Both algorithms are implemented in quite a few libraries, most notably the
`sentencepiece` library and the Hugging Face `tokenizers` package.

# Multilingual and Unsupervised Translation

Many attempts at multilingual translation.

- Individual encoders and decoders, shared attention.

- Shared encoders and decoders.

~~~
Surprisingly, even unsupervised translation is attempted lately.
By unsupervised we understand settings where we have access to large
monolingual corpora, but no parallel data.

~~~
In 2019, the best unsupervised systems were on par with the best 2014 supervised
systems.

section: Transformer
# Attention is All You Need

For some sequence processing tasks, _sequential_ processing (as performed by
recurrent neural networks) of its elements might be too restrictive.

~~~
Instead, we may want to be able to combine sequence elements independently on
their distance.

~~~
Such processing is allowed in the **Transformer** architecture, originally
proposed for neural machine translation in 2017 in _Attention is All You Need_
paper.

section: SelfAttention
# Transformer – Self-Attention

Assume that we have a sequence of $n$ words represented using a matrix $⇉X ∈ ℝ^{n×d}$.

~~~
The attention module for queries $⇉Q ∈ ℝ^{n×d_k}$, keys $⇉K ∈ ℝ^{n×d_k}$ and values $⇉V ∈ ℝ^{n×d_v}$ is defined as:
$$\textrm{Attention}(⇉Q, ⇉K, ⇉V) = \softmax\left(\frac{⇉Q ⇉K^\top}{\sqrt{d_k}}\right)⇉V.$$

~~~
The queries, keys and values are computed from the input word representations $⇉X$
using a linear transformation as
$$\begin{aligned}
  ⇉Q &= ⇉X ⇉W^Q \\
  ⇉K &= ⇉X ⇉W^K \\
  ⇉V &= ⇉X ⇉W^V \\
\end{aligned}$$
for trainable weight matrices $⇉W^Q, ⇉W^K ∈ ℝ^{d×d_k}$ and $⇉W^V ∈ ℝ^{d×d_v}$.

# Transformer – Multihead Attention

Multihead attention is used in practice. Instead of using one huge attention, we
split queries, keys and values to several groups (similar to how ResNeXt works),
compute the attention in each of the groups separately, concatenate the
results and multiply them by a matrix $⇉W^O$.

section: FFN
# Transformer – Feed Forward Networks

## Feed Forward Networks

The self-attention is complemented with FFN layers, which is a fully connected
ReLU layer with four times as many hidden units as inputs, followed by another
fully connected layer without activation.

# Transformer – Decoder

![w=28%,f=right](transformer.png)

## Masked Self-Attention

During decoding, the self-attention must attent only to earlier positions in the
output sequence.

~~~
This is achieved by **masking** future positions, i.e., zeroing their weights out,
which is usually implemented by setting them to $-∞$ before the $\softmax$ calculation.

~~~

## Encoder-Decoder Attention

In the encoder-decoder attentions, the _queries_ comes from the decoder, while the
_keys_ and the _values_ originate from the encoder.

# Transformer – Positional Embeddings

## Positional Embeddings

We need to encode positional information (which was implicit in RNNs).

~~~
- Learned embeddings for every position.

~~~
- Sinusoids of different frequencies:
  $$\small\begin{aligned}
    \textrm{PE}_{(\textit{pos}, 2i)} & = \sin\left(\textit{pos} / 10000^{2i/d}\right) \\
    \textrm{PE}_{(\textit{pos}, 2i + 1)} & = \cos\left(\textit{pos} / 10000^{2i/d}\right)
  \end{aligned}$$

~~~
  This choice of functions should allow the model to attend to relative
  positions, since for any fixed $k$, $\textrm{PE}_{\textit{pos} + k}$ is
  a linear function of $\textrm{PE}_\textit{pos}$, because
  $$\small\begin{aligned}
    \textrm{PE}_{(\textit{pos}+k, 2i)}
      &= \sin\left((\textit{pos}+k) / 10000^{2i/d}\right) \\
      &= \sin\left(\textit{pos} / 10000^{2i/d}\right) ⋅ \cos\left(k / 10000^{2i/d}\right) + \cos\left(\textit{pos} / 10000^{2i/d}\right) ⋅ \sin\left(k / 10000^{2i/d}\right) \\
      &= \textit{offset}_{(k,2i)} ⋅ \textrm{PE}_{(\textit{pos}, 2i)} + \textit{offset}_{(k, 2i+1)} ⋅ \textrm{PE}_{(\textit{pos}, 2i + 1)}.
  \end{aligned}$$

section: Training
# Transformer – Training

## Regularization

The network is regularized by:
- dropout of input embeddings,
~~~
- dropout of each sub-layer, just before it is added to the residual
  connection (and then normalized),
~~~
- label smoothing.

~~~
Default dropout rate and also label smoothing weight is 0.1.

~~~
## Parallel Execution
Because of the _masked attention_, training can be performed in parallel.

~~~
However, inference is still sequential.

---
# Transformer – Training

## Optimizer

Adam optimizer (with $β_2=0.98$, smaller than the default value of $0.999$)
is used during training, with the learning rate decreasing proportionally to
inverse square root of the step number.

~~~
## Warmup
Furthermore, during the first
$\textit{warmup\_steps}$ updates, the learning rate is increased linearly from
zero to its target value.

$$\textit{learning\_rate} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{d_\textrm{model}}} \min\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{\textit{step\_num}}}, \frac{\textit{step\_num}}{\textit{warmup\_steps}} ⋅ \frac{1}{\sqrt{\textit{warmup\_steps}}}\right).$$

~~~
In the original paper, 4000 warmup steps were proposed.

## Main Takeaway

Generally, Transformer provides more powerful sequence-to-sequence architecture
and also sequence element representation architecture than RNNs, but usually
requires substantially more data.
