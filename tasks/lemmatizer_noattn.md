### Assignment: lemmatizer_noattn
#### Date: Deadline: May 2, 7:59 a.m.
#### Points: 3 points

**The templates will be finalized shortly.**

The goal of this assignment is to create a simple lemmatizer. For training
and evaluation, we use the same dataset as in `tagger_we` loadable by the
updated [morpho_dataset.py](https://github.com/ufal/npfl114/tree/master/labs/10/morpho_dataset.py)
module.

Your goal is to modify the
[lemmatizer_noattn.py](https://github.com/ufal/npfl114/tree/master/labs/10/lemmatizer_noattn.py)
template and implement the following:
- Embed characters of source forms and run a bidirectional GRU encoder.
- Embed characters of target lemmas.
- Implement a training time decoder which uses gold target characters as inputs.
- Implement an inference time decoder which uses previous predictions as inputs.
- The initial state of both decoders is the output state of the corresponding
  GRU encoded form.
